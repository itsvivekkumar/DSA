1. Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
    >select * from CITY where population > 100000 and CountryCode='USA';

//column names are case sensitive

5.Query the following two values from the STATION table:
The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.

    > SELECT round(sum(lat_n),2),round(sum(long_w),2) FROM station;

//distinct(means unique) is used to remove duplicate value from that column, mod() means id%2.
6.Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

     > SELECT distinct city FROM station WHERE mod(id,2)=0;

//count() used to total no of value present in that column.
7. Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

    > SELECT count(city)-count(distinct city) FROM station;

//length() gives us column me present value ka length, order by means which order values need to present ascending/descending.
//limit gives fixed no of result from that column
8.Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

     >SELECT city,length(city) FROM station ORDER BY length(city), city limit 1;   //ascending order me sort ke liye
     >SELECT city,length(city) FROM station ORDER BY length(city) DESC, city limit 1;

//like means it matches with requirement,(%A= staring matches with A,a snd  %A = ending matches with A,a)
9.Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

    >SELECT distinct city FROM station where (city like 'A%' or
      city like 'E%' or
      city like 'I%' or
      city like 'O%' or
      city like 'U%' );


9.1 CITY names ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) , then just change (city like '%A')
9.2 CITY names having both starting and ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) , then just change (city like '%A') and (city like '%A')
9.3 CITY names not starting and ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) , then just change not (city like '%A') and (city like '%A')
9.4 CITY names with either starting or ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) , then just change (city like '%A') or (city like '%A')


10.Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than  38.788 and less than 137.234 . Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.4

    > SELECT round(sum(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n > 38.7880 and lat_n < 137.2345;

11. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.234 . Round your answer to  4 decimal places.

     >SELECT round(long_w,4) FROM station WHERE
        lat_n = (SELECT max(lat_n) from station where lat_n < 137.2345);

12. Consider two points on a 2D plane (a,b) and (c,d)
 Query the Manhattan Distance(MD) between points, MD= abs(c-a)+abs(d-b)

    >SELECT round(abs(b-a)) + abs(d-c) , 4) FROM station;

13. Euclid distance forumula , sqrt[pow(b-a , 2) +  pow(d-c , 2) ]

     >SELECT round(sqrt(pow((a,b), 2) + pow((c,d), 2)) , 4) FROM station;

//Floor means nearest smallest integer[ 2.3 =2 , 2.9=2], Ceil means nearest greatest integer[ 3.2 =4 , 3.8=4]
14. Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest integer.
     >SELECT floor(avg(population)) from city;

//Group by means grouping same row value of a column, concat and substring means adding string, part of string.
15.[VVI] Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of occurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

o/p format = There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.

where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

  >SELECT concat(name,'(',substring(occupation,1,1),')') from occupations ORDER BY name;

  >SELECT concat('There are a total of ',count(occupation),' ',lower(occupation),'s.')
    from occupations GROUP BY occupation
      ORDER BY count(occupation),occupation;


//replace() used to replace 0 from salary value with null.
16. Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries without any zeros), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (actual average salary- miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

  select ceil(avg(salary) - avg(replace(salary,0,''))) from employees;


//count(*) means jitne max( salary*months) wale honge usko count karke return karega.
17. We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly (sal*months) worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table.
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

  select max(salary*months), count(*) from employee
where salary*months=(select max(salary*months) from employee);

18. 1,2,3 highest salary
  Select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc, limit 1;
  Select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc, limit 1 offset 1;  //skip first row
  Select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc, limit 1 offset 2;   //skip first 2 row
