1. Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
     select * from CITY where population > 100000 and CountryCode='USA';

//column names are case sensitive
2. Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA

      select name from city where population > 120000 and countrycode ='USA';

3. Query all columns for a city in CITY with the ID 1661.
      SELECT * from city where id = 1661;

4.Query the names of all the Japanese cities in the CITY table. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.
     select name from city where countrycode = 'JPN';

//round used to decide decimal point, sum() return sum from the name passed in it.
5.Query the following two values from the STATION table:
The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.

      SELECT round(sum(lat_n),2),round(sum(long_w),2) FROM station;

//distinct(means unique) is used to remove duplicate value from that column, mod() means id%2.
6.Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

       SELECT distinct city FROM station WHERE mod(id,2)=0;

//count() used to total no of value present in that column.
7. Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

     SELECT count(city)-count(distinct city) FROM station;

//length() gives us column me present value ka length, order by means which order values need to present ascending/descending.
//limit gives fixed no of result from that column
8.Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

     SELECT city,length(city) FROM station ORDER BY length(city), city limit 1;   //ascending order me sort ke liye
     SELECT city,length(city) FROM station ORDER BY length(city) DESC, city limit 1;

//like means it matches with requirement,(%A= staring matches with A,a snd  %A = ending matches with A,a)
9.Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT distinct city FROM station where (city like 'A%' or
city like 'E%' or
city like 'I%' or
city like 'O%' or
city like 'U%' );


9.1 CITY names ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) , then just change (city like '%A')
9.2 CITY names having both starting and ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) , then just change (city like '%A') and (city like '%A')
9.3 CITY names not starting and ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) , then just change not (city like '%A') and (city like '%A')
9.4 CITY names with either starting or ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) , then just change (city like '%A') or (city like '%A')


10.Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than  38.788 and less than 137.234 . Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.4

     SELECT round(sum(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n > 38.7880 and lat_n < 137.2345;

11. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.234 . Round your answer to  4 decimal places.

     SELECT round(long_w,4) FROM station WHERE
        lat_n = (SELECT max(lat_n) from station where lat_n < 137.2345);

12. Consider two points on a 2D plane (a,b) and (c,d)
 Query the Manhattan Distance(MD) between points, MD= abs(c-a)+abs(d-b)

    SELECT round(abs(b-a)) + abs(d-c) , 4) FROM station;

13. Euclid distance forumula , sqrt[pow(b-a , 2) +  pow(d-c , 2) ]

     SELECT round(sqrt(pow((a,b), 2) + pow((c,d), 2)) , 4) FROM station;
